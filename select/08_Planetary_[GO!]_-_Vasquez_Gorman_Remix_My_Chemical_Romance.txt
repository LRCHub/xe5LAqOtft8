There might be something outside your window
But youll just, never know
There could be something right past the turnpike gates
But youll just never know

If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just dont let go
And if the heaven aint got a vacancy
Then we just, then we just, then we just
Then we just get up and go!

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Truth is now acceptable
Fame is now injectable
Process the progress
This core is critical
Faith is unavailable
Lives become incredible
Now please understand that

I cant slow down
I wont be waiting for you
I cant stop now
Because Im dancing
This planets ours to defend
Aint got no time to pretend
Don't fuck around this is our last chance

If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just dont let go
Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
And we just, and we just, and we just
And we just get up and go!

Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Kill the party with me
And never go home

Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home

Youre unbelievable
So unbelievable
You ruin everything
Oh you better go home
Im unbelievable
Yeah, Im undefeatable
Yeah, lets ruin everything
Blast into the back row
They sell presentable
Young, and so ingestible
Sterile and collectable
Safe and I cant stand it
This is a letter, my word is the berretta
The sound of my vendetta
Against the ones that planned it

If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just dont let go
Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
Tell me who do you trust, do you trust
And we just get up and go!

Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Kill the party with me
And never go home

Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home

You keep eternity, give us the radio
Deploy the battery,
Were taking back control
Engage the energy, light up the effigy
No chance to take it slow
By now Im sure you know
Know, know know know
Get up and go!

Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Kill the party with me
And never go home
Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home

Are we still having fun?
Are you holding the gun?
Take the money and run
And never come back

Ive got nothing to lose
Youve got nothing to say
And were leaving today
Well never go home
Get up and go!
Go home

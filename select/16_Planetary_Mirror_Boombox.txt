Meet me out there in the sun
We'll listen to our favorite country preacher
If it ain't paradise I'll show you round the world
Just a world bridger your planetary mirror.

Your word was known to ride
On wings that can glide
I turned around all the world is a stage
Slip and slide baby you're well on your way.

Meet me out, there in the sun
We'll listen to our favorite country preacher
If it ain't paradise I'll show you round the world
Just a world bridger your planetary mirror.

I heard you playing right on through it
Like there was nothing to it
All the fancy faces waiting for the word
Flip the switch baby
And ill pull the plug

Your word was known to ride
On wings that can glide
I turned around all the world is a stage
Slip and slide baby you're well on your way.
